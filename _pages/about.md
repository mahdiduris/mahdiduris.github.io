I'm a research assistant and Ph.D. student in Applied Linguistics and Technology (ALT) at Iowa State University. My research interest is in the area(s) of pronunciation, phonetics, and phonology. Specifically, the automation of intelligibility ratings by way of the Acoustic Masking and Intelligibility (AMI) theory. I also research on Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD) systems.<br/>

My current ongoing project is to document the segmental and suprasegmental features of Saudi Spoken English. Currently, no research has focused on exclusively documenting the features of English spoken by Saudis. As I develop my research around this topic, it will be made available here:<br/>
