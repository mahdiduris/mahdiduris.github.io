My research interests revolve around pronunciation, phonetics, and phonology, particularly in relation to the automation of intelligibility ratings using the Acoustic Masking and Intelligibility (**AMI**) theory. In a broader sense, my focus encompasses the study of phonetic characteristics in second language speech, evaluating the intelligibility of L2 speakers, and exploring technological approaches to enhance language acquisition.<br/>

My ongoing project is to document the segmental and suprasegmental features of **<nobr>Saudi Spoken English</nobr>** (SSE). Currently, no research has focused on exclusively documenting the phonetic features of English spoken by Saudis. Doing so can shed light on pedagogical implications for teaching Saudi students, provide valuable data for Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (**CAPT**), and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (**MDD**) systems. As I develop my research around this topic, it will be made available here:<br/>
