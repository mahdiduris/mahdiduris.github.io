My research interests revolve around technology-driven approaches to second language pronunciation, second language writing, and AI in education. My work focuses on pronunciation, phonetics, and phonology, particularly the automation of intelligibility ratings, as well as Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) and the integration of AI in EFL/ESL contexts. I am currently a research assistant to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z9d6h_YAAAAJ" target="_blank" style="text-align: center; color: #005700; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Dr. John Levis</a> (NSF-funded project) and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uu4KGj8AAAAJ" target="_blank" style="text-align: center; color: #005700; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Dr. Volker Hegelheimer</a> (U.S. Department of State-funded project).<br/>

My ongoing project is to document the segmental and suprasegmental features of **<nobr>Saudi Spoken English</nobr>** (SSE). Currently, no research has focused on exclusively documenting the phonetic features of English spoken by Saudis. Doing so can shed light on pedagogical implications for teaching Saudi students and provide valuable data for Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (**CAPT**) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (**MDD**) systems. As I develop my research around this topic, it will be made available here:<br/>
