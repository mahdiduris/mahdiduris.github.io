I'm a research assistant and Ph.D. student in Applied Linguistics and Technology (ALT) at Iowa State University. My research interest is in pronunciation, phonetics, and phonology. Specifically, the automation of intelligibility ratings by way of the Acoustic Masking and Intelligibility (**AMI**) theory. I also conduct research on Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (**MDD**) systems.<br/>

My ongoing project is to document the segmental and suprasegmental features of Saudi Spoken English. Currently, no research has focused on exclusively documenting the phonetic features of English spoken by Saudis. Doing so can shed light on pedagogical implications for teaching Saudi students, provide valuable data for Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (**CAPT**) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (**MDD**) systems. As I develop my research around this topic, it will be made available here:<br/>
