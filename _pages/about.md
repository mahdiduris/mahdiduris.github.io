My research interests revolve around technology-driven approaches to second language pronunciation, second language writing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education. My pronunciation work focuses on phonetics and developing automated systems for intelligibility ratings. I also research Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) and the integration of AI in EFL/ESL learning environments.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of English at Iowa State University, where I focus on the intersection of Applied Linguistics and AI. I investigate the ways generative AI technologies are used to simulate or enhance human communication, particularly in advice-seeking, reasoning, and expressions of empathy. My research aims to deepen our understanding of the linguistic, cognitive, and ethical dimensions of AI-mediated language use.
